# C++ Programs: Basic Input/Output and Arithmetic Operations

## Overview
This repository contains two basic C++ programs designed for beginners. The first program introduces console output using `cout`, while the second demonstrates user input and basic arithmetic operations using `cin`. These foundational exercises help new learners become familiar with C++ syntax, structure, and standard input/output operations.

## Program 1: Hello World and Introduction

**Purpose**  
This program demonstrates how to display messages on the console using the `cout` stream. It prints a greeting followed by a name, serving as an introductory exercise to C++ programming and console output.

**Concepts Covered**
- Standard Library Usage: Includes necessary libraries for input/output functionality.
- Program Entry Point: Uses the `main` function as the starting point of execution.
- Console Output: Utilizes `cout` to print text to the terminal.
- Output Formatting: Demonstrates how to organize output on multiple lines.
- Program Termination: Ends with `return 0;` to indicate successful execution.

## Program 2: Arithmetic Operations

**Purpose**  
This program accepts two floating-point numbers as input from the user and performs four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results are then printed to the console.

**Concepts Covered**
- User Input: Uses the `cin` stream to accept input from the user.
- Data Types: Employs the `float` data type to handle both integers and decimal values.
- Arithmetic Operations: Demonstrates use of addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) operators.
- Variables: Stores results of calculations in separate variables.
- Operator Precedence: Reinforces understanding of how operations are evaluated.
- Input Validation: Highlights the need to handle division by zero appropriately.

## Conclusion

These two C++ programs provide a basic introduction to input/output operations and arithmetic processing. The first program emphasizes formatting and console output, while the second builds on that foundation by incorporating user input, calculations, and conditional logic. Together, they form a solid starting point for understanding C++ syntax and program flow.
